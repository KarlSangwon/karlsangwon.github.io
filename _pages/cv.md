Research/Work Experience
======
* 10/2022 – Present: Medical Student Researcher
  * NYU Langone Health – OLAB, New York, NY
  * Initiated and led a flagship project with diffusion model application for prediction of brain metastases post-SRS, awarded National Neurosurgery NREF 2023 Fellowship. Project was accepted and presented at 2023 Congress of Neurological Surgery National Conference.
  * Collaborated with other neurosurgeons to solve clinical problems using data science. With Dr. Erez Nossek, a cerebrovascular neurosurgeon, I performed the main analysis of the role of Virtual Reality devices on anastomosis surgery planning. With Dr. Derryl Lau and his spine surgery team, I have served as the data scientist on studies investigating role of neuromonitoring data on spine surgery outcomes as well as several clinical outcome projects. With Dr. Harter, I served as the data scientist on studies investigating neurosurgical outcomes of patients in Public and
Private Hospitals in NYC.
