My name is *Karl L. Sangwon*. I'm currently a **Medical Student at NYU Grossman School of Medicine**, who has interest in Computational Medicine research and entrepreneurships for Neurosurgery. My main interest lies in augmenting and exploring new perspectives on modern *Art of Medicine* using advanced technologies, to create a more 21-century-like 'cyberpunk' medical paradigm that fits my vision. It is my passionate vision to expand, represent, and clinically re-define our traditional definitions as well as approaches toward ‘diseases and disorders’ in a more mathematical, computable, and surgical manner.

I received my B.S. in Neuroscience, Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and Computational Medicine at Johns Hopkins University in 2022, where I spent most of my time doing neurodegeneration, multi-omics computational genomics, radiomics research.

My current primary research interest areas is in application of computational analytics in cerebrovascular neurosurgery, as well as data science in healthcare. 

I'm a first-generation Korean American and also an amateur Artist. I came to US alone when I was 14 to start a new life - since then I've been sailing towards the north star of American Dream...
Outside of academics I have a wide array of art and cultural interests - I have been a backpack camper, painter, guitarist, and many others. Chances are, I'm learning a new hobby or trying out some random things at the moment.
