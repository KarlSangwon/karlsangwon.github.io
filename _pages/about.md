A bit about me:

My name is Karl L. Sangwon. I'm currently a medical student at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who has interest in Artificial Intelligence research and entrepreneurship. My main interest lies in augmenting modern medicine using advanced technologies, to create a more 21-century-like 'cyberpunk' medical paradigm that fits my vision.

I received my B.S. in Neuroscience, Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and Computation Medicine at Johns Hopkins University in 2022, where I spent most of my time doing neurodegeneration, multi-omics computational genomics, radiomics research.

I'm a first-generation Korean American, and outside of academics I have a wide array of art and cultural interests. I have been a backpack camper, painter, guitarist, and many others. Chances are, I'm learning a new hobby or trying out some random things at the moment.
